Dear TLVGDS enginers,
  Please keep in mind the following formating guidelines when contributing code, so that we can have a clean readable repo
  1. Our chosen naming convention is camelBackVariables, what this means is that if you create a variable in your code, please name it like such, with an apropriate name
  2. Tab for this repo is 2, please dont change that.
  3. When you can, please use Xml comments so that others can read/understand your code, xml comments are formated as follows,
    ///<tag>
    ///this is an xml comment
    ///</tag>
    where the tag can be summary, code, and others, if you want to know more xml comment tags, ask owen. (sorry owen)
  4.every time you use curly brackets {}, please indent. please.
  
                                                                                            Thank you.
